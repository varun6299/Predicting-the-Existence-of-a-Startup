# Predicting-the-Existence-of-a-Startup
A Machine Learning project to build a classification model to predict the survival or acquisition of a Startup.


## **Business Case**
Establishing a startup is a highly risky move which involves a lot of sustaining efforts due to the high failure rates associated and unpredictable nature of the business environment. Hence, in order to survive and grow in the market, before setting up or during early stages, a startup needs to consider several factors like market, location, finances, competition, technology, etc. Taking the right or wrong decision in respect to these factors can impact chances of survival of the organization. It could also affect the ability to get funds from several sources.

## **Approach to the Case**
To build a classification model to identify the startups, based on their market, location and finances acquired, which are going to continue to operate, get acquired or in a worst case scenario, be forced to close down.
